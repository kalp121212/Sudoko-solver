# Sudoko-solver

Given an image, this code detects whether a sudoku is present and extracted digits from it using openCV library in python. I have implemented a CNN to train on MNIST dataset, my model gives an accuracy of about 98.66 percent database. This model is used to predict the extracted digit. Due to these being printed digits rather than handwritten MNIST images, accuracies are slightly lower and i have manually added 2-3 corrections to the sample sudokus present.
